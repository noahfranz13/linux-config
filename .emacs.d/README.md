# My *modernized* emacs configuration files, all in one place

To get this up and running use
1. clone this repo and rename it to the `~/.emacs.d` directory.
2. `sudo snap install emacs --clasic`
3. install the necessary fonts with `~/emacs.d/fonts/install-fonts.sh`

Or feel free to mess with and modify as necessary. In general, this will
basically just give you a fully customizable version of the modern text
editors.

The `nano-emacs` directory contains style sheets from the `nano-emacs`
repository: https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs.
